# Udacity-DAND-Python-DataWrangling

*Introduction*

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The goal of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.

*Data*

The data for this project consists of three pieces:

1.	The WeRateDogs Twitter archive with the contents and metadata for the WeRateDogs tweets (called “archive”)
2.	Tweet image predictions: what breed of dog is present in each tweet according to a neural network (called “images”)
3.	The tweet's retweet count and favorite count, acquired by querying the Twitter API (called “rtfav”)
